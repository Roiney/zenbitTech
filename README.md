<h1 align="center"> Technical Challenge for zenbitTech Company </h1>
The technical challenge consisted of an application responsible for registering a form in a relational database, with the frontend programmed in the React library and the backend being a Nodejs application with the typeORM ORM performing the connection with the MySQL database.

For this challenge, a form screen was developed that is fed by an API.

<h1 align="center"> How to run the application </h1>
To run the application on your machine, please follow some steps described below:

*Clone the repository to your machine;
*Run npm install in the application root directory, in the frontend directory and in the beckend directory;
*Create a SCHEMA named zenbitTech on your MySQL server and check the environment settings in the .env file that is responsible for connecting the database with the application;
*After the Schema is created, in the beckend directory run the migrations with the command npm run typeorm migration:run;
*Next, run the server. The application is pre-configured with the npm run dev command to facilitate this step;
*In the frontend directory, run the npm start command, responsible for the Angular server.

By following these steps, you can access the application's localhost and consume it.
